# Mental Health Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes a university mental health dataset from Kaggle to investigate the prevalence of depression, panic attacks, and anxiety among students across different academic courses. It also evaluates treatment-seeking behavior. The analysis aims to enhance understanding of mental health literacy among college students and identify gaps in support systems.

## Key Findings
- **64 out of 100 students** reported experiencing depression, panic attacks, or anxiety.
- **Only 6 students** sought specialist treatment.
- **BCS (Bachelor of Computer Science) students** had the highest rates of depression, anxiety, and panic attacks, with **18 students** reporting each condition.

## Methodology
### 1. Data Source & Preparation
- Dataset: Sourced from Kaggle, containing student responses on mental health status, including depression, anxiety, panic attacks, and treatment-seeking behavior.
- Tools: Data was loaded into **MySQL** for exploratory analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Demographic Overview**: Analyzed age range, gender distribution, and marriage rates.
- **Mental Health Prevalence**: Aggregated counts of students reporting depression, anxiety, or panic attacks by gender and academic course.
- **Treatment-Seeking Behavior**: Identified students who sought specialist treatment.
- **Comorbidity Analysis**: Isolated students experiencing all three conditions versus any one condition.

### 3. Data Visualization
- **Tool**: **Power BI** was used to create an interactive dashboard.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Bar charts showing depression and panic attacks by academic course.
  - Column chart displaying anxiety rates by academic course.
  - Pie chart representing the proportion of students who sought specialist treatment.
  - Slicers for filtering by gender and marital status.
  - Total survey participant count (100) for reference.

## Insights
- High prevalence of mental health issues among students, particularly in the BCS program.
- Low rates of professional treatment-seeking behavior, indicating a need for increased awareness and support.

## Tools Used
- **MySQL**: For exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.

## Recommendations
1. **Mental Health Literacy Campaign**:
   - Educate students on the benefits of professional therapy.
   - Raise awareness about symptoms and impacts of common mental health disorders.

2. **Further Research**:
   - Investigate causes of poor mental health among BCS students, focusing on academic pressures (e.g., workload, job market anxiety).

## Conclusion
The analysis highlights a significant gap between mental health challenges and treatment-seeking behavior among students. Targeted interventions and support for high-risk groups are essential to address these issues effectively.
